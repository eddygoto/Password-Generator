# Password-Generator

homework 3

## Description

This project was intended to be a test on JavaScript in order to get a random password generator up and running. I needed to pose a series of questions to use the user including password length and what characters they would like to use, and use these answers to generate a random password for them.
I ran into a lot of confusion when working on this project but breaking down each and every seperate idea indivually helped me tackle it a lot easier. My biggest issue ended up being creating the different cases of when one of the booleans were true or not. I was unable to get a working product by concatenating into a character set array no matter how many different ways I tried, so I ended up brute forcing and writing code for each combination. It definitely wasn't the most efficient way to do this project, but I ended up finding success and completing the assignment.

## Installation
